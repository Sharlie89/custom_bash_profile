# Custom bash_profile

Is tested on Mac OS X. This bash is a compliation of alias, reminders and other things useful that I found/create.
Feel free to use it. 

Usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/Sharlie89/custom_bash_profile
```

Then you have to copy the bash_profile (according to your OS) to your user's home:

```
cp custom_bash_profile/OS/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
```
